# csgo-image-aimbot
Work in progress CSGO object recognition-based aimbot using Tensorflow's object recognition API. To be used for an adversarial examples-based anti-cheat concept.

csgo_internal is used to compile a DLL to be injected to the game itself, and is a crude way to get labeled training data by reading the game memory itself.
